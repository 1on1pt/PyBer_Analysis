# PyBer_Analysis
Exploratory analysis on data to help improve ride share accessibility.
## Overview of the Analysis
As a new data analyst with PyBer, I was tasked with developing an exploratory analysis and creating visulizations by building various charts that would help to tell a story and provide insight on how to boost access to rideshare services and improve affordability in underserved neighborhoods.  Data was provided via two .csv files that contained such metrics as city, date, fare ($USD), ride ID, driver count, and type of city (urban, suburban, and rural).  A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was developed to create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.  This analysis was performed writing code script with Python using the Pandas library, Matplotlib, and the Jupyter Notebook and presented to the executive team at PyBer.

### Resources
Data Source:  city_data.csv; ride_data.csv

Code:  PyBer_Challenge.ipynb

Software:  Python 3.7.6; Pandas 1.3.5; Matplotlib; Jupyter Notebook

## Results
PyBer provides ridesharing in diverse locations, including urban, suburban, and rural areas.  In effort to optimize operations, PyBer also collects extensive data as it relates to city, date, fare ($USD, ride ID, driver count, and type of city (urban, suburban, and rural).

Primary differences amongst the data can be observed through the three types of city:
* Urban
* Suburban
* Rural

For instance, the following bubble chart shows that in general, the Urban city type has more drivers, cheaper fares, and total number of rides than Suburban and Rural city types.
