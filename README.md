# PyBer_Analysis
Exploratory analysis on data to help improve ride share accessibility.
## Overview of the Analysis
As a new data analyst with PyBer, I was tasked with developing an exploratory analysis and creating visulizations by developing various charts that would help to tell a story and provide insight on how to boost access to rideshare services and improve affordability in underserved neighborhoods.  Data was provided via two .csv files that contained such metrics as city, date, fare ($USD), ride ID, driver count, and type of city (urban, suburban, and rural).  A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was developed so that a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type.  This analysis was performed writing code script with Python using the Pandas library, Matplotlib, and the Jupyter Notebook.
